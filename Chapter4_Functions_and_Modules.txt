Title: "Programming Fundamentals: From Basics to Proficiency"

#### Chapter 4: Functions and Modules

##### Defining and calling functions
Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses (). The code block within every function is indented and executed when the function is called.

Here's a simple example of a function in Python:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Calling the function
greet()
```

In this example, 'greet' is a function that prints "Hello, World!" when called.

##### Scope and lifetime of variables
In programming, the scope of a variable refers to the region within the code where a variable can be accessed. A variable can have local scope (accessible only within the function where it is defined) or global scope (accessible throughout the program).

The lifetime of a variable refers to the period during which the variable exists in the memory while the program is running. The lifetime of a local variable extends only within the function in which it is defined. On the other hand, a global variable has a lifetime that extends from the point it is defined until the end of the program.

##### Modular programming and code reuse
Modular programming is a design technique that involves dividing a program into separate modules or functions. Each module is a self-contained unit that can be tested separately and reused in different parts of the program. This approach improves the readability, maintainability, and scalability of the code.

Remember, understanding how to define and use functions is a key aspect of becoming a proficient programmer. Don't be afraid to experiment with creating your own functions and modules - that's part of the learning process!

We hope that this chapter has given you a good understanding of functions and modules in programming. In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into the concept of data structures.
