Title: "Programming Fundamentals: From Basics to Proficiency"

#### Chapter 7: Error Handling and Debugging

##### Common types of programming errors
In programming, errors are inevitable. They are part of the learning process and can be categorized into three main types: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors. Syntax errors occur when the programmer does not follow the rules of the programming language. Runtime errors occur during the execution of the program, and logic errors occur when the program does not perform as intended due to incorrect logic.

##### Exception handling mechanisms
Exception handling is a mechanism that handles runtime errors and exceptions, preventing the program from crashing. It involves using specific blocks of code (try, catch, finally) that capture exceptions and decide how to respond to them. This allows the program to continue running even when an error occurs.

##### Basic debugging techniques
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. Basic debugging techniques include stepping through the code, using breakpoints to pause the execution of the program at a certain point, and using print statements to check the values of variables. Debugging can be a challenging task, but it is an essential skill for any programmer.

Remember, encountering errors is a normal part of programming. Don't be discouraged when you encounter them - instead, use them as learning opportunities to improve your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of the programming language.

We hope that this chapter has given you a good understanding of error handling and debugging in programming. In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into working with files and I/O.
