Title: "Programming Fundamentals: From Basics to Proficiency"

#### Chapter 11: Introduction to Web Programming

##### Overview of web development
Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. It can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. Web development usually involves client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

##### Understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are the three core technologies used in creating web pages and web applications.

HTML is used to structure content on the web. It uses tags to denote different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, and tables.

CSS is used to style the HTML content and layout of the web page. It controls how the web page looks, including colors, fonts, and layouts.

JavaScript is used to make the web page interactive. It can be used to create features like image sliders, form validations, responsive menus, and more.

Here's a simple example of a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body {background-color: powderblue;}
        h1   {color: blue;}
        p    {color: red;}
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Hello, World!')">Click me</button>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the HTML creates the structure, the CSS styles the page, and the JavaScript adds interactivity.

##### Client-server architecture
In web development, the client-server architecture is a model where a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (usually a web application running on a web server), using the HTTP protocol. The server then responds to the client; this response is typically in the form of a web page.

Remember, understanding these concepts is crucial to becoming a proficient web developer. Don't be afraid to experiment with different HTML tags, CSS properties, and JavaScript functions - that's part of the learning process!

We hope that this chapter has given you a good introduction to the world of web programming. In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into databases and SQL.
